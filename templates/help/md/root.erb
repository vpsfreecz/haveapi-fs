SPECIAL FILES
-------------
Every directory can contain the following special files:

`help.{html,txt,md,man}`
  Auto-generated files containing information about the current directory.

`.unsaved`
  Contains a list of subdirectories and files that have been modified and not
  saved.

`.reset`
  An executable that resets the current directory upon invocation, i.e. all
  descendant directories and files are dropped from memory and will have to
  be loaded again.

RESOURCES
---------
<% @c.resources.each do |name, r| %>
*<%= safe_print(name) %>*
  <%= r.description[:description] %>
<% end -%>
